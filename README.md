# Unity Package: Finite State Machine

This is a robust and flexible system for creating State Machines and State Patterns. It is perfectly suited for managing complex logic in your Unity game. This package offers a variety of machines to meet your specific needs:

- **StateMachine**: For traditional State Machines.
- **TypeMachine**: For State Patterns.
- **FlagMachine**: For State Machines with Flags.
- **FlypeMachine**: For State Patterns with Flags.

## Features

- **Flexible State Types**: Use any type as a state. This package does not impose any restrictions on the type of your states, giving you total flexibility in designing your state logic.

- **Multiple Active States**: Have the capability to activate multiple states at the same time. This is particularly useful for complex state interactions.

- **State Transitions**: Easily configure transitions between states. This makes it simple to define how your state machine should behave as it moves from one state to another.
